# 👋 Welcome to the ACSPRI LLM Course

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

Over three intensive days, you’ll gain practical experience in:

**Prompt Architecture**: Designing systematic frameworks (Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot) to transform LLMs into reliable qualitative coders.

**Semantic Analysis**: Using embeddings to map "meaning" across thousands of documents and visualizing thematic clusters without manual reading.

**Privacy-First Research**: Deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) and local workflows to process sensitive data behind university firewalls.

**Verifiable Systems**: Building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines that eliminate hallucinations by forcing models to cite their sources.

**Agentic Orchestration**: Designing "Research Teams" of autonomous agents that collaborate, critique, and audit each other to ensure academic rigor.

**The Methodological Audit**: Generating transparent "thought logs" and reproducibility reports to meet the highest standards of peer-reviewed publication.

## 🛠️ Course Toolkit

Each session is designed as a "lab-to-desk" transition, paired with:

🔍 GitBook Foundations: Deep-dive theoretical guides and evergreen conceptual explainers.

🧩 Modular Code Templates: Plug-and-play Google Colab notebooks tailored for social science datasets.

🧠 Real-World Research Use Cases: Practical applications from survey analysis to ethnographic coding.

## 📅 Course Structure

### 📅 Day 1: Foundations – From "Chatting" to "Coding"

**Understand the "probabilistic" nature of LLMs and master the 'Researcher’s Minimum' in Python and Google Colab**

- The Mechanics of Language Models. How LLMs actually "think" (tokens, temperature, and context windows).

- Prompt Engineering for Social Scientists. Moving beyond basic chat to structured frameworks: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Few-Shot learning, and Persona-adoption for qualitative coding.

- Intro to "Low-Code" environments. LLM as "research instrument" via Python, GoogleColab toolkit. Building pipelines that are **reproducible** and **shareable**.

---

### 📅 Day 2: Mapping Meaning & Qualitative Scaling

**Understand how LLMs "see" meaning and how to use them for large-scale qualitative coding and "grounded" analysis.**

- Meaning in Multidimensional Space: Embeddings & Sentence Transformers. Visualizing "textual distance" and navigating the trade-off between Tokens vs. Context Windows.

- The Logic of Retrieval: Managing thousands of documents using Vector Databases. Semantic search vs. keyword search for finding themes.

- Data Sovereignty and evaluation strategies for embedding-based workflows.

---

### 📅 Day 3: Advanced Research Workflows & Autonomous Agents

**Transition from using tools to building "Audit-Ready" research systems with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Agentic Reseach Teams, *

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): How to "talk to your documents" without uploading them to a public server.

- Agentic Research Teams: Beyond the single prompt. Evaluation Crisis (LLM-as-a-Judge)

- Ethics, Privacy, and Deployment. Best practices for working with sensitive data and ensuring academic integrity. Audit Trail & Methodological Transparenc

---

## 🎓 Who This Is For

This course is designed for:

- Social scientists working with text  
- Analysts exploring automation  
- Academic researchers using LLMs  
- Policy, media, health, law, and government professionals  

No coding experience is required — but we **do not avoid code**.  
You’ll leave with reusable tools, templates, and a research-ready pipeline.

---

## 🛠️ System Requirements

To follow along live, you’ll need:

- Google Chrome or Safari  
- A Google account for Colab (no install needed)  
- An OpenAI or Gemini API key (free tiers are fine)  
- Optional: GitHub for saving notebooks

---

## 🔮 After the Course

All course materials are designed to be portable assets for your future work. You will leave this intensive with:

🧱 **A Reproducible Research Framework:** A complete, modular codebase in Python that serves as a high-performance "skeleton" for your future data cleaning, coding, and analysis.

🛠️ **Custom-Built Research Tools:** A collection of specialized templates for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Agentic workflows that you can immediately adapt to your own datasets.

🧠 **Algorithmic Literacy:** A deep conceptual understanding of LLM architectures—enabling you to justify your AI-assisted methodology to ethics boards and peer reviewers.   


Welcome aboard.
