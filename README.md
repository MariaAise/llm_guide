# 👋 Welcome to the ACSPRI LLM Course

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

Over three intensive days, you’ll gain practical experience in:

✅ Prompting strategies and prompt architecture  
✅ Using APIs from Gemini, OpenAI, and Hugging Face  
✅ Representing meaning with embeddings and cosine similarity  
✅ Building document-aware systems with RAG pipelines  
✅ Structuring and deploying intelligent agents using LangChain  

Each concept is paired with:

- 🔍 GitBook references  
- 🧩 Modular code templates  
- 🧠 Real-world research use cases

## 📅 Course Structure

| Day | Theme | Topics |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [**Day 1**](./codebook/day1s1_schedule.md) | Interfaces + Prompts | Prompt logic, APIs, LLM behavior |
| [**Day 2**](./codebook/day2s1_schedule.md)| Meaning + Retrieval | Embeddings, classification, similarity |
| [**Day 3**](./codebook/day3s1_schedule.md) | Planning + Control | RAG, agents, orchestration, tools |

You can follow along with the GitBook materials.

## 🎓 Who This Is For

This course is designed for:

- Social scientists working with text  
- Analysts exploring automation  
- Academic researchers using LLMs  
- Policy, media, health, law, and government professionals  

No coding experience is required — but we **do not avoid code**.  
You’ll leave with reusable tools, templates, and a research-ready pipeline.

## 📁 How To Use This GitBook

- Start from the [Day 1 overview](codebook/day1s1_schedule.md) or use the sidebar  
- Each session has its own `.md` page with links to:
  - 🔹 GitBook reference material  
  - 🔹 Python notebooks (`.ipynb`)  
  - 🔹 Codebook logic (`.md` or `.yaml`)  
  - 🔹 Streamlit UI blocks (where applicable)

If you get lost: jump to the [All Sessions Index](sessions_index.md)  
Or ask Maria directly during a break — she’ll enjoy it.

## 🧭 Your Toolkit

This GitBook includes:

- ✅ **GitBook Pages** → Long-term reference & documentation  
- ✅ **Jupyter Notebooks** → Hands-on demos (Colab-ready)  
- ✅ **Codebook Modules** → Reusable `.md` logic blocks  
- ✅ **Figma Visuals** → Research-ready diagrams  
- ✅ **Streamlit Apps** → Prototypes and UI scaffolds

---

## 🛠️ System Requirements

To follow along live, you’ll need:

- Google Chrome or Safari  
- A Google account for Colab (no install needed)  
- An OpenAI or Gemini API key (free tiers are fine)  
- Optional: GitHub for saving notebooks

---

## 🔮 After the Course

Everything here is yours to keep and reuse.  
You’ll leave with:

- 🧠 An understanding of LLM systems  
- 🧱 A modular codebase to build from  
- 🧩 Tools and templates for your own research  
- 🌐 A GitBook that evolves with the field

This isn’t about learning a product — it’s about learning **control**.

Welcome aboard.
