# 🔧 Fine-Tuning LLMs with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) enables you to customize a pretrained model (like BERT, GPT, or LLaMA) for your own tasks, data, or domain. However, standard fine-tuning requires substantial resources.

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** is a parameter-efficient technique that dramatically reduces the cost of fine-tuning by injecting lightweight trainable layers into the model.

## 🧠 Why Fine-Tune LLMs?

Fine-tuning adapts a general-purpose model to your specific task:
- **Classification** (e.g., stance, sentiment, intent)
- **Question Answering**
- **Summarization**
- **Dialogue / Chatbot behavior**
- **Domain-specific reasoning** (e.g., legal, biomedical)

## 🔍 Fine-Tuning: A Comprehensive Explanation

Fine-tuning is a **transfer learning** technique where a **pre-trained model** is further trained on a **new, task-specific dataset** to adapt it to a particular application.

### 🔹 Key Benefits
1. **Requires Less Data**
2. **Faster Training**
3. **Better Performance**

### 🔹 Step-by-Step Process
1. Start with a pre-trained model  
2. Replace the final layer (e.g., classification head)  
3. Train on new data (full, partial, or LoRA)  
4. Evaluate & deploy  

### 🔹 Types of Fine-Tuning

| Type | When to Use | Strategy |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Full | New tasks, large datasets | Train all layers |
| Partial | Small datasets, similar task | Train top layers |
| PEFT / LoRA | Low-resource, small model updates | Add LoRA modules |

## 🚀 What is LoRA?

LoRA avoids updating all weights in a massive model. Instead:
- The **original model is frozen**
- Small **adapter modules** are inserted into key components (e.g., attention)
- Only these are trained via low-rank matrix decomposition

```text
ΔW ≈ A @ B   where A ∈ ℝ^{d×r}, B ∈ ℝ^{r×d}, with r ≪ d
```

## 💡 Use Cases

| Scenario | Use LoRA? |
|----------|-----------|
| Domain adaptation (e.g., finance, law) | ✅ |
| Small labeled datasets | ✅ |
| Full model retraining needed | ❌ |
| Multi-task or multi-lingual setups | ✅ |

## 🛠️ Basic LoRA Implementation

```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

peft_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type="SEQ_CLS",
    r=8,
    lora_alpha=16,
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    target_modules=["q_lin", "v_lin"]
)

model = get_peft_model(base_model, peft_config)
model.print_trainable_parameters()
```

---

## 🧪 Training Tips

- Use `Trainer` from Hugging Face
- Include `EarlyStoppingCallback`
- Track `accuracy`, `F1`, `loss`
- Save and reuse LoRA adapters

```python
model.save_pretrained("./my_lora_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./my_lora_model")
```

---

## 🧰 Example: Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment

```python
from transformers import (
    BertTokenizer, 
    BertForSequenceClassification,
    Trainer, 
    TrainingArguments
)

model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=3)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

train_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="./results", per_device_train_batch_size=8, num_train_epochs=3)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=train_args,
    train_dataset=train_data,
    eval_dataset=val_data
)

trainer.train()
```
