# ‚öôÔ∏è LoRA / PEFT Fine-Tuning Boilerplate

This guide walks you through the essential steps to fine-tune a transformer model using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, a technique under the broader umbrella of **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**.

LoRA enables you to fine-tune large models efficiently by updating only a small number of parameters‚Äîsaving compute and memory.

üëâ This is ideal when:
- You want to **adapt a pretrained model** (e.g. BERT) to your own classification task
- You are working with **limited computational resources** (e.g. Google Colab)
- You have **hundreds or thousands** of labeled samples, not millions
- You want to integrate your model into a **retrieval system** or **research pipeline**

This module provides a clean and minimal setup for **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** using **LoRA**.

It is ideal for adapting Hugging Face models like `bert-base-uncased`, `distilbert-base-uncased`, or domain-specific transformers to your own classification tasks.

## üì¶ Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Before you begin, make sure you have all required libraries installed. These tools come from the Hugging Face ecosystem and LoRA via `peft`.
If you're running this in Google Colab, paste the following into a code cell:

```bash
pip install -q peft transformers accelerate datasets
```

---

## üß† Step 2: Load Model and Apply LoRA

Here, we load a base transformer model for sequence classification and apply a **LoRA adapter** using PEFT.

- `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` loads a model like BERT with a classification head
- `LoraConfig` tells PEFT how to insert the adapter
- `get_peft_model()` wraps the base model and applies LoRA

This means you're **not changing the original BERT weights** ‚Äî just adding trainable blocks on top.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
from peft import get_peft_model, LoraConfig, TaskType

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    "distilbert-base-uncased",  # or any transformer
    num_labels=3
)

config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.SEQ_CLS,
    r=8,
    lora_alpha=32,
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    bias="none"
)

model = get_peft_model(model, config)
model.print_trainable_parameters()  # Shows how many parameters are being trained (should be a small %)
```

---

## üß™ Step 3: Train the Model with Hugging Face Trainer

Now we set up the training loop using Hugging Face‚Äôs `Trainer` API.

- `TrainingArguments` control batch size, learning rate, and evaluation frequency
- `compute_metrics()` defines how to calculate accuracy on validation data
- `EarlyStoppingCallback` stops training if performance plateaus

This setup assumes you already have a `tokenized` dataset split into `train` and `test` keys.

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer
from transformers import EarlyStoppingCallback
import numpy as np

def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    predictions, labels = eval_pred
    predictions = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
    return {"accuracy": (predictions == labels).mean()}

args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./peft_model",
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    learning_rate=2e-4,
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
    eval_steps=20,
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    metric_for_best_model="accuracy"
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=args,
    train_dataset=tokenized["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized["test"],
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    callbacks=[EarlyStoppingCallback(early_stopping_patience=2)]
)

trainer.train()
```

---

## üîç Step 4: Inference with Softmax Scores

After training, you‚Äôll want to classify new text. This function tokenizes the input, feeds it into the model, and returns **softmax probabilities**.

Softmax gives you a score between 0‚Äì1 for each label. The label with the highest score is the predicted class.

```python
import torch

def predict(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True).to(model.device)
    with torch.no_grad():
        logits = model(**inputs).logits
        probs = torch.nn.functional.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
    return probs
```

---

## üíæ Step 5: Save and Load the Model

Saving your fine-tuned model lets you reuse it in other notebooks, dashboards, or even deploy it via the Hugging Face Hub.

You‚Äôll save both:
- The PEFT-wrapped model (`model.save_pretrained()`)
- The tokenizer, so future inputs are processed the same way

```python
model.save_pretrained("./peft_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./peft_model")

from peft import PeftModel
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, "./peft_model")
```

---



## ‚úÖ Summary

This boilerplate gives you a **complete fine-tuning loop** with LoRA and Hugging Face transformers.

You're training **only a few parameters** on top of a large, frozen model:
- Faster to train
- More memory efficient
- Still highly accurate when well-configured

üëâ Use this template whenever you want to personalize a base model to your task ‚Äî without the cost of full fine-tuning.
