# 🧠 The ReAct Loop: Thought → Action → Observation

The **ReAct** framework allows language models to **reason** about what they know, **act** using external tools, and **observe** new information — in a structured loop.

This loop gives agents the ability to think, try, reflect, and iterate — just like a human working through a complex task.

## 🔄 The ReAct Sequence

| Step            | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| **Thought**      | The model reflects: “What do I need to do next?” |
| **Action**       | The model chooses a tool (e.g., Search, Calculator) |
| **Action Input** | The model supplies arguments to the tool |
| **Observation**  | The model receives and reads the tool’s output |
| **Repeat / Final Answer** | If needed, it loops again. If ready, it returns a response |

## 📌 Example Walkthrough

> **User**: _"Where did the Texas Longhorns play last week? What is the address of the other team's stadium?"_

### Agent Loop

1. **Thought**: I need to find the game results for the Texas Longhorns.
2. **Action**: `search("Texas Longhorns football schedule")`
3. **Observation**: The result says they played the Georgia Bulldogs.
4. **Thought**: I now need the address of Georgia’s stadium.
5. **Action**: `places("Georgia Bulldogs stadium")`
6. **Observation**: The stadium address is 100 Sanford Dr, Athens, GA.
7. **Final Answer**: _“They played the Georgia Bulldogs. The stadium address is 100 Sanford Dr, Athens, GA 30602.”_

## 🎯 Why ReAct Matters

Without this loop:
- LLMs **guess** based on training data (risk of hallucination)
- They cannot interact with tools
- They don’t reflect or revise mid-task

With ReAct:
- Agents become **goal-directed**
- They can **decompose a query into substeps**
- They can **use tools to get fresh, real-world info**

## 🔧 How LangChain Implements It

LangChain supports ReAct via:

```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools)
```
Each call to the agent steps through:

Prompt with question + tool schema

ReAct output from the model

Tool execution

Observation

Decision: loop again or finish

🧠 Comparison: ReAct vs Chain-of-Thought

| **Feature**        | **Chain-of-Thought** | **ReAct** |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------- |
| Internal reasoning | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Yes     |
| Tool use           | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes     |
| Observations       | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes     |
| Looping / planning | ❌ Static             | ✅ Dynamic |
