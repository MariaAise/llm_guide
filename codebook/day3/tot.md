# üå≤ Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)

### üß† What It Is

**Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)** is a reasoning framework where an LLM **explores multiple reasoning paths**, evaluates their outcomes, and chooses the best one.
Unlike Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which commits to a single line of logic, ToT allows the model to simulate multiple ideas in parallel ‚Äî like brainstorming or hypothesis testing.

It‚Äôs a powerful approach for tasks with **ambiguity**, **multiple valid interpretations**, or **open-ended reasoning goals**.

---

## üß© Step-by-Step Breakdown

Here‚Äôs how a typical ToT workflow works:

| Step | Action                                                                                 |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | **Start with a user question** (e.g. "How should we code this ambiguous quote?")       |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | **Generate multiple thoughts** (candidate interpretations, classifications, or plans)  |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | **Evaluate each thought** (based on logic, relevance, evidence, or a scoring function) |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£  | **Select or combine** the most promising one(s)                                        |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£  | **Output a final answer** based on the best path or a merged insight                   |

The result is more **robust, deliberative reasoning** ‚Äî less prone to premature conclusions or hallucination.

## üîç Example in Action (Social Science Coding)

### üßæ Prompt:

*"Code the following statement as either: Supports, Neutral, or Opposes the policy. Be aware the statement may be ambiguous."*

### üîπ Quote:

*"I get why they‚Äôre doing it, but it feels like no one actually asked us what we needed."*

---

### üå≤ ToT Response:

**Thought 1:**

> The speaker acknowledges the rationale: ‚ÄúI get why they‚Äôre doing it.‚Äù ‚Üí Could be **Neutral** or **Supports**.

**Thought 2:**

> The phrase ‚Äúno one actually asked us‚Äù implies exclusion and dissatisfaction ‚Üí Could be **Opposes**.

**Thought 3:**

> The overall tone is mixed: agreement with motive, frustration with process ‚Üí Likely **Neutral**, but leaning toward **Opposes**.

**Evaluation:**

* Thought 1 misses emotional tone
* Thought 2 highlights key discontent
* Thought 3 offers a balanced synthesis

**Final Answer:** **Opposes** (soft opposition due to lack of inclusion)

## üõ† How to Implement ToT (as a Developer)

ToT is more complex than CoT or ReAct ‚Äî because you‚Äôre **running and scoring multiple reasoning paths**.

### ‚úÖ Core Requirements:

1. **LLM interface**: Generate multiple thoughts from the same input
2. **Evaluation strategy**: Score or rank responses based on clarity, logic, or task-specific metrics
3. **Selection logic**: Choose best one or synthesize across multiple
4. **Looping controller**: (Optional) Repeat with refined thoughts if needed

---

### üîß Sample Architecture (Python )

```python
question = "Code this quote: ..."
thoughts = []

# Step 1: Generate multiple candidate thoughts
for _ in range(3):
    thought = call_llm(prompt=f"{question}\nGenerate a thought:")
    thoughts.append(thought)

# Step 2: Score or compare thoughts
scored = []
for t in thoughts:
    score = call_llm(prompt=f"Evaluate this reasoning:\n{t}")
    scored.append((score, t))

# Step 3: Choose best
final = sorted(scored, reverse=True)[0][1]
print("Final Answer:", final)
```

### ‚úÖ Tools/Libraries to Use:

* `langgraph` or `langchain` if you want flow-based control
* `openai`, `transformers`, or `vllm` for inference
* Your own scoring function or a second model for ranking

## ‚öñÔ∏è When to Use ToT (vs CoT or ReAct)

| Scenario                                   | Best Framework   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Clear logic, one answer                    | CoT              |
| Needs tool use (search, classify, extract) | ReAct            |
| Ambiguous or subjective judgment           | ToT              |
| Multi-hypothesis generation                | ToT              |
| Creative synthesis or planning             | ToT or ReAct+ToT |

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

* Handles ambiguity and open-ended reasoning
* Reduces premature conclusions
* Enables multiple perspectives in analysis
* Can be used for *interpretation, synthesis, or evaluation*

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* **Slower** ‚Äî multiple LLM calls per input
* **More expensive** ‚Äî higher token cost and latency
* **Complex orchestration** ‚Äî needs scoring logic, evaluation criteria
* **Still experimental** ‚Äî few out-of-the-box libraries

---

## üîÅ ToT + CoT or ReAct: Stackable

* You can run CoT **within each ToT branch**
* Or use ReAct + ToT for dynamic workflows that explore tools **and** multiple paths

üîÆ What‚Äôs Next?

Next: `tools.md`

‚û°Ô∏è You‚Äôve explored how agents can simulate multiple reasoning paths with Tree-of-Thoughts.
Now we turn to tools ‚Äî the core enablers of real-world action.
In this module, you‚Äôll learn how agents identify, select, and invoke external tools (e.g. APIs, search functions, PDF readers) based on task context.
We‚Äôll cover how to define tools, register them in code, and build the tool orchestration layer that powers intelligent workflows in research, analysis, and automation.

This is where agents stop thinking ‚Äî and start doing.
